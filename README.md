## Product
#### A system used for the Boston College student base to aid in the class registration period.

When spots fill up in a course, students tend to sit there and try to refresh the page as much as possible to see when a spot will open up, but often they will miss it due to having to go to class or just stepping away from their laptop. EagleVision takes this out of the equation, as it monitors the classes 24/7 during the registration and add/drop period, and will send an email to all of the students who added a class to their watchlist once a spot opens up. Students can add any section of a course to a watchlist, are able to edit those watches if they want another section, and are able to delete them from their watchlist if they no longer need the notification. Admin users can do all of this, as well as see a report screen of all of the courses that students have added to a watchlist, and a list of each class of the students currently watching each section.
